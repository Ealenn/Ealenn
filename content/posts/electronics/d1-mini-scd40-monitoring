## Introduction:
In this article, we'll explore how to set up a temperature, humidity, and CO2 monitoring system using the D1 Mini microcontroller and the SCD40 sensor.
We'll cover configuring Home Assistant with ESPHome, the protocol for flashing the ESP, and provide a pin schema for connecting the components.
Additionally, if you have access to a 3D printer, we'll share a 3D-printed enclosure for this project along with instructions on how to connect the pins.

## Hardware Components:
To begin, gather the following components:
- D1 Mini microcontroller board
- SCD40 sensor (temperature, humidity, and CO2)
- Jumper wires
- USB cable for power

## Pin Schema and Connection
The following pin schema describes how to connect the SCD40 sensor to the D1 Mini:

|D1 Mini | SCD40 Sensor|
|---|---|
|3.3V| VCC|
|GND| GND|
|D1| SDA|
|D2| SCL|

## 3D-Printed Enclosure:
If you have access to a 3D printer, you can use the following instructions to create an enclosure for the D1 Mini and SCD40 sensor:

# Conclusion
By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily set up a temperature, humidity, and CO2 monitoring system using the D1 Mini microcontroller and the SCD40 sensor.
Integrating the project with Home Assistant through ESPHome provides seamless integration into your home automation ecosystem.
Additionally, the 3D-printed enclosure ensures a neat and organized setup.
